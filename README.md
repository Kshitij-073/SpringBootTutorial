# SpringBootTutorial
Main objective is to understand CRUD operations in Spring Boot . This is done by having a  list of students which 
includes their name , id and course name and updating , adding and deleting items from that list . For the purpose of this
project , data is populated while declaring the list itself and not fetched from a database as that was not the primary focus
